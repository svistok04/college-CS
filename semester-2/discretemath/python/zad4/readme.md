# Pollard's rho algorithm

### This program utilizes Pollard's Rho algorithm to factorize integers. The user can input an integer of their choice or retrieve one from the "data.txt" file (the program allows the user to factorize multiple numbers from the file until the end of the file is reached).

### While the program is generally effective for many numbers, it is important to note that certain numbers may be challenging to factorize due to the algorithm's limitations. Based upon my observations, it appears that some small numbers and some large even numbers are impossible to factorize. However, in cases where such numbers are encountered, the program continues its execution successfully.
