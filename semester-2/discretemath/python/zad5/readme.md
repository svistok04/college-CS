# System of Congruences Solver Using Chinese Remainders Theorem
#### This program utilizes the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve a system of congruences. It applies the extended Euclidean algorithm to find modular inverses.

#### The user provides a system of congruences according to the desired problem. Each congruence is in the form of x ≡ ai mod ni, where x is the unknown variable, ai is the remainder, and ni is the modulus.
#### It calculates and displays the following characteristics of the system:
1. #### The product of all moduli (n)
2. #### The products of all moduli except the current one (Ns) T
3. #### The modular inverses (Ms) - based on Ns 
4. #### Finally, the program presents the solution in the form of congruences x ≡ ai mod ni, where x represents the result, ai denotes the remainder, and ni represents the modulus (in the order user entered them).
