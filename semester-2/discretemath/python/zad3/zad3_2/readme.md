# Graphical Representation of the Divisibility Relation for Numbers from 1 to 100

###  This program generates visual representations of the divisibility relations between numbers from 1 to 100. It provides two different visualizations: a scatter plot and a directed graph.

1. #### Scatter Plot: The scatter plot shows the divisibility relation between numbers. The X-axis represents the divisors, and the Y-axis represents the numbers being divided (dividends). Each dot on the plot indicates that a particular number is divisible by a specific divisor.

2. #### Directed Graph: The directed graph illustrates the divisibility relation using nodes and arrows. Each number from 1 to 100 is represented by a node. An arrow is drawn from a divisor to the number it divides, indicating the direction of the divisibility relation.
