This program creates a "forest" in console by generating a large grid of zeros. Within the forest, various objects are placed at specific (x, y) coordinates using different symbols and colors. The objects are represented by classes (Triangle, RightTriangle, Rectangle, Border) that inherit from a main Shape class. The program then prints the forest with the objects using the printForest function. This allows for a visual representation of the forest with its various objects.
