A simple C program to learn fork() Linux system calls. It accepts a single argument: a decimal digit string with a length of 2 to 25 characters. Then it performs a recursive operation by forking child processes until only a single digit is left, at which point it returns this digit. In higher recursive calls, it sums up the exit statuses of child processes and outputs the results. Additionaly, each call, along with the results, prints its parent-process PID and its own PID.
