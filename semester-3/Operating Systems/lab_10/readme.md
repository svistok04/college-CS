A simple C program written to learn the basics of Linux's pthreads library. It calculates an approximation of Ï€ using a specified number of terms and threads. The program accepts two arguments: the number of terms and the number of threads, performs the calculation in parallel using pthreads, and synchronizes access to a shared variable using a mutex. It also demonstrates the efficiency of parallel computation by comparing the execution times with and without threading.
