A simple C program written to learn about creating child processes using Windows system calls. It accepts a single argument: a decimal digit string with a length of 2 to 25 characters. Then it performs a recursive operation by creating child processes with CreateProcessA until only a single digit is left, returning this digit. In higher recursive calls, it sums up the exit codes of child processes and outputs the results. Additionaly, each call, along with the results, prints its parent-process PID and its own PID.
