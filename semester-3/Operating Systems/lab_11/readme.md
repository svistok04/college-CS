A simple C program written to learn about thread management and synchronization using mutexes on Windows. It performs a sum of array elements in parallel, distributing the workload across multiple threads. The program accepts two parameters: the total number of elements to sum and the number of threads to create. It also demonstrates the efficiency of parallel computation by comparing the execution times with and without threading.
