A simple C program designed to learn IPC through shared memory on Windows by facilitating a two-player Battleship game. The program manages the order of players joining to ensure that both players are connected before the game starts. It divides responsibilities into two roles, each handled by separate instances of the application running in different terminal windows. Players take turns making moves on a shared game board, represented in a shared memory segment. The synchronization of turns is implemented using a spinlock mechanism, ensuring that players alternate turns. Each player's move updates the board, and after each turn, the program checks for a win or draw. This system ensures that both players see consistent and real-time updates to the game board, maintaining data integrity and synchronicity throughout the gameplay.
