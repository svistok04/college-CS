# Python Battleship Game with Qt
This project is a Battleship game implemented in Python using the Qt framework for the graphical user interface. The game allows a player to compete against the computer, adhering to all the classic rules of Battleship. Each step of the gameplay, from ship placement to combat, is fully realized through a graphical user interface (GUI), enhancing the interactive gaming experience.
### Features
- Graphical User Interface: Built using Qt, the interface provides a clear and interactive user interface for both setting up the game and for gameplay.
- Single-Player Mode: The game currently supports a single-player mode where the player competes against a computer-controlled opponent. All moves are updated in real-time on the game board, creating a dynamic and competitive environment.
- Ship Placement: Players can manually position their ships on the grid, choose random placement, or upload predefined layouts for themselves and the computer. Additionally, these layouts can be saved for future games. The game preserves the traditional Battleship rules and logic throughout, ensuring a fair setup phase and strategic gameplay.
- Combat System: The game features comprehensive hit or miss feedback mechanisms, tracking each player's progress towards the game's conclusion. Ultimately, the game enforces a clear win-lose logic.
### Current State of the Project
The game is functional with features such as graphical navigation, ship placement, game progression, and win detection implemented. However, there are still issues with handling ship placement using the GUI, and particularly problems with displaying hits on the board.
Some parts of the code are not perfectly optimized or might not follow best coding practices. Nonetheless, it serves well for educational purposes and as a functional prototype.

### Icons and Graphics
Most of the icons used in this game were designed by me. However, some were sourced online to complement my designs.
